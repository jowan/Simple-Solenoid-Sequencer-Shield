There are two versions here, the code is the same, just different pinouts.

The SMD version is the pre-build shield bought in one piece with everything done for you.
The TH version is the through hole kit for doing it yourself.

As well as the Arduino code, the Eagle PCB designs are here too, as well as the drill files for manufacture.
